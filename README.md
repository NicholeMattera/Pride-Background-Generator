# Pride Background Generator

A small single page app for generating custom pride backgrounds. The inspiration for this work is based off a background that I used for awhile that had the Trans, Lesbian, and Pride flags rotated 45 degrees. ([Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns/comments/depebm/i_made_a_4k_wallpaper_that_has_the_trans_lesbian/)) The purpose of this app is to allow anyone to create their own background with any arrangement of flags.
